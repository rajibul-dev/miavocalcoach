            <span class="about-text-inside-margin">
              I have been offering voice lessons on a paid and pro bono basis since 2019. Continuously honing my skills, I have trained with teachers Silva Makamian (opera, pop) and Aliki Katriou (distortion) and completed the New York Vocal Coaching Teacher Training Course. My approach, heavily inspired by Feldenkrais, is now further enhanced through my enrollment in the Robert Sussuma Teacher Training Program. Additionally, I actively study Brian Gill's work and learn from the teachers he has trained.
            </span>
            
            <span class="about-text-inside-margin">
              My teaching approach emphasizes minimizing tension, enabling the body to produce powerful, natural sounds. I specialize in coaching the highest registers of the voice, extending range and tone to their full potential, and cultivating an effortless mixed voice—my unique "One Voice" approach.
            </span>
            
            <span class="about-text-inside-margin">
              Currently in my fourth and final year pursuing a degree in Psychology and Vocal Pedagogy, I am well-equipped to teach individuals with general joint hypermobility, GERD, ADHD/ADD, and those on the autism spectrum. I firmly believe that posture, physical well-being, and mental health are essential for both exceptional singing and a fulfilling life.
            </span>
            
            <span class="about-text-inside-margin">
              As a voice teacher, I help beginners grasp the fundamentals efficiently and effortlessly. As a vocal coach, I specialize in Pop and confidently teach all microphone genres.

              Mia is amazing! She has done so much to help me find more confidence and power with my voice. She is very patient and kind, and is extremely effective at explaining things clearly. I really love how much she personalizes lessons and helps you understand some of the science behind singing—whenever I struggled with a new technique, so she did so much to help me pinpoint exactly what was holding me back and how to fix it. She is very smart and talented, and she’s definitely the best vocal teacher I’ve ever had! 🙂

              Mia is a wonderful coach! I'm so glad I happen to bump into one of her many helpful posts on reddit. She guided me through learning to unlock a new voice within me. This made it so much more comfortable to sing in general. Mia has helped me develop a new relationship with my voice and singing, and now can envision a brighter future in my life journey with it. She is so supportive while still being able to call you out directly when you know you're doing something wrong. Definitely would recommend her if you're looking to improve yourself!

              I've been one of Mia's students for several months now, and I can't recommend her enough. Before we began lessons, I was having horrible pain in my throat when I sang, and it even hurt to talk. She helped me be able to sing without pain. It was something I was desperate to fix and had gone to several doctors asking for help. One had suggested a singing teacher, and I feel like I could not have found a better person to help me than Mia. She is a really patient and kind teacher, overflowing with knowledge and passion when it comes to helping her students. I felt like my future as far as singing was over until I started having classes with her. Some classes were even a bit emotional as she helped me realize that there was hope for me yet. Not only can I sing more easily now, but I can feel myself improving with every new exercise I learn from her. Thanks to her, I can continue my singing journey, and I can't wait to improve even more with her guidance. I feel very lucky to be one of her students. Seriously, thank you so much Mia!

              If you want to learn to sing or want to take your singing to the
              next level, TAKE MIA'S LESSONS. Seriously, her lessons are all one
              need to start singing. I made a decision to train my vocals like 3
              years ago and have been practicing and doing vocal workouts that I
              found on YouTube pretty consistently ever since but nothing worked
              as fast and as good as Mia's lessons. Within a week my tone
              improved and singing became pretty much effortless for me, now
              after three months of lessons almost every week and due to her
              constant guidance I am able to sing in balanced mix and can go up
              and down my range pretty easily without straining. I've gotten
              many compliments on my singing ever since I started learning
              singing from her. The technique she teaches is THE best because
              before using it, singing used to painful for me. The dedication
              she puts in teaching each of her students can really be seen and
              also if you got any singing related issue, she'll provide
              solutions for that instantly. My vocals keep getting better now
              and it couldn't have been possible without her. Last but not
              least, learning is fun and comfortable with her if you're a shy
              person like me. She teaches and explains depending on how you
              understand it and depending upon the nature of each student. I
              could go on but I'd stop it here.

              Well, I’ve been through a lot of vocal coaches, but none has
              taught me the way Mia did. Things have never been so clear, and
              the progress with her is great. Mia has really brought back the
              passion, and hope to get better to my singing journey. I felt
              stuck, like driving in neutral, because I never understood what do
              I do, how the voice works, and what are the relations of specific
              exercises to my voice. Mia has made everything clear, reasonable
              and coherent. Mia has helped me understand complicated ambiguous
              vocal techniques that I could never figure out without her. Since
              we’ve started, I’ve been getting a lot of compliments on my voice,

              Mia provides really easy and fun exercises that are made that one
              can assimilate them as effortlessly as possible. Improving my
              voice (health wise, general understanding of its functions and
              registers) was way less easy when using random youtube videos
              without feedback. The one on one lessons, the structured guides
              and sources she gives and the support of her and her staff have
              really helped me personally, even in the beginning of my journey
              to mastering singing and I am very thankful. There are still
              obstacles, but Mia is always open to helping and giving great tips
              to get through the rough parts of this adventure. The lessons are
              always interesting and diverse, and any styles are possible to
              work through! She is understanding and supportive even when you
              feel self-conscious. Would 100% recommend working with her. No
              inconvenience, 10/10.

              I came into Mia’s lessons with no prior experience. I was a
              beginner in every describable way. She helped me improve within a
              short amount of time, and I’ve seen my voice transform under her
              guidance. She answered any questions I had regardless of what it
              was not only during our lessons but on her own time as well. She
              also was very flexible with her scheduling as I was going through
              a tough time during the first month of our lessons she understood
              and allowed me to reschedule multiple times which is something I
              cannot be more grateful for. You can tell that this is something
              she is passionate about and loves doing which is the best thing
              you can ask for from any coach. While she would correct my
              technique and give me tips she would never be harsh with me and
              instead gave constructive criticism on every aspect of my voice,
              and again I cannot be more grateful for everything she has done
              for me.

              I started working on my singing like 3-4 months ago. I had couple
              different vocal coaches but they were all talking about different
              things and I felt that somehow my end goal became ” hit ” this
              note, that note instead of doing what I love and what I want to
              do, which is performing. And short after realizing this, I stopped
              my lessons and started looking for new vocal coach, looked here
              and there and I saw this discord at Reddit, I was like couldn’t
              hurt let’s give it a shot. I joined couple group lessons, asked
              many questions then I started taking lessons from Mia. But just
              waow, it’s been just three lessons but oh boy even in this time my
              range extended like perfect fourth up (F5-A#5) and couple notes
              down and I feel a loooot more comfortable and in general singing
              and performing looks more achievable now. My most favourite part
              of her lessons is she somehow manages to listen and answer every
              single question you ask (even if you are like me and ask the
              world’s handpicked most stupid questions). It’s just awesome.

              With Mia’s approach to teaching, not only was I able to quickly
              find my mixed voice, and eventually unlock flageolet register, but
              she has also helped me to learn to sing without pain, use proper
              breath support, and develop my vocal style. Whatever vocal problem
              I bring to Mia, she is always dedicated to finding the perfect
              technique to fix it.
